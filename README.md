# ctlogs
A cli for interacting with the [Certificate Transparency logs](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/known-logs).

# Supported logs
Currently `ctlogs` will just pull information from the [Google aviator logs](https://ct.googleapis.com/aviator/ct/v1/get-sth). However, the plan is to support all Certificate Transparency logs.
